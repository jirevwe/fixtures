# Fixtures


This is a demo project being created to learn how to use
 - [x] Dependency injection using Dagger2
 - [x] RxJava/RxAndroid
 - [x] MVP architecture pattern.
 - [ ] Hopefully I'd get to write some Kotlin :smiley:
 
 The app will use an [open football scores api](http://api.football-data.org/) to show realtime scores.
